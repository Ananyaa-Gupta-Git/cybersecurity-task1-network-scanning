## Device Analysis

### 1. Router/Gateway (192.168.1.1)
**Device Type**: Huawei Router  
**Status**: Active  
**Risk Level**: Medium

**Open Ports:**
- **Port 53 (DNS)**: Domain Name Service
  - *Risk*: Low - Normal DNS service
  
- **Port 80 (HTTP)**: Web management interface
  - *Risk*: Medium - Unencrypted router admin panel
  - *Recommendation*: Use HTTPS only, change default credentials
  
- **Port 443 (HTTPS)**: Secure web interface
  - *Risk*: Low – Assuming strong TLS configuration and no default credentials
  - *Recommendation*: Regularly update router firmware to patch vulnerabilities

**Filtered Ports (Behind Firewall):**
- **Port 21 (FTP)**: File Transfer Protocol
- **Port 22 (SSH)**: Secure Shell
- **Port 23 (Telnet)**: Unencrypted remote access

### 2. Samsung Device (192.168.1.3)
**Device Type**: Samsung Electronics Device (likely smartphone/tablet)  
**Status**: Active  
**Risk Level**: Very Low

**Open Ports:** None detected - All ports closed/filtered
**Security Status:** Excellent - Device appears well-secured

### 3. Unknown Device (192.168.1.4)
**Device Type**: Possibly a VoIP device (e.g., SIP phone or intercom system); requires further identification.
**Status**: Active  
**Risk Level**: Low

**Filtered Ports:**
- **Port 5060 (SIP)**: Session Initiation Protocol (VoIP)
  - May be a VoIP phone or similar device

### 4. Unknown Device (192.168.1.11)
**Device Type**: Unknown Device  
**Status**: Active  
**Risk Level**: Very Low

**Open Ports:** None detected - All ports closed/filtered

### 5. Your Computer (192.168.1.54)
**Device Type**: Windows PC  
**Status**: Active  
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL

**Open Ports:**
- **Port 135 (RPC)**: Microsoft RPC
  - *Risk*: Medium - Windows networking service
  
- **Port 139 (NetBIOS)**: NetBIOS Session Service
  - *Risk*: High - Legacy Windows file sharing
  
- **Port 445 (SMB)**: Microsoft Directory Services
  - *Risk*: CRITICAL - Major ransomware target
  
- **Port 3306 (MySQL)**: MySQL Database Server
  - *Risk*: High - Database exposed to network

## Security Risk Assessment

### High Risk Issues
1. **Port 445 (SMB) on Personal Computer**
   - Vulnerable to ransomware and lateral movement attacks
   - Should be blocked at firewall level
   
2. **SSH Service on Server**
   - Potential brute force attack vector
   - Needs strong authentication measures

### Medium Risk Issues
1. **HTTP Services on Router and Server**
   - Unencrypted management interfaces
   - Credentials can be intercepted
   
2. **Multiple Windows Services on Personal Computer**
   - Increase attack surface
   - Some services may be unnecessary

### Low Risk Issues
1. **DNS Service on Router**
   - Normal operation but monitor for DNS hijacking
   
2. **HTTPS Service on Router**
   - Properly encrypted but verify certificate

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Disable SMB (Port 445)** on personal computer if not needed
2. **Change default router credentials**
3. **Implement key-based SSH authentication** on server
4. **Enable Windows Firewall** with restrictive rules

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)
1. **Implement HTTPS-only** for router management
2. **Set up SSL certificate** for web server
3. **Disable unnecessary Windows services**
4. **Update all device firmware/software**

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)
1. **Network segmentation** (separate IoT devices)
2. **Regular security scanning** schedule
3. **Intrusion detection system** implementation
4. **Security awareness training**

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: External Attacker
If an attacker gains access to the network:
1. Could exploit SMB vulnerabilities on personal computer
2. Attempt SSH brute force on server
3. Try default credentials on router

### Scenario 2: Malicious Insider
An insider with network access could:
1. Access unencrypted router interface
2. Exploit Windows services for lateral movement
3. Access web server content

### Scenario 3: IoT Device Compromise
If the IoT device is compromised:
1. Could be used as pivot point
2. Network scanning from trusted internal IP
3. Potential for command and control communications

## Compliance Considerations
- **PCI DSS**: If handling card data, network segmentation required
- **GDPR**: Personal data on compromised systems could lead to breaches
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data requires additional security controls

## Monitoring and Detection

### Log Sources to Monitor
1. Router access logs
2. SSH authentication attempts
3. Windows security event logs
4. Network traffic anomalies

### Key Indicators of Compromise
- Multiple failed SSH attempts
- Unusual network traffic patterns
- New devices appearing on network
- Unexpected service installations

## Conclusion
The network scan revealed several security concerns that require immediate attention. While no critical vulnerabilities were directly exploitable from external networks, the combination of open services creates multiple attack vectors that could be chained together by an attacker.

The most critical issue is the exposure of SMB services, which have been frequent targets of ransomware attacks. Implementing the recommended security measures will significantly improve the overall security posture of the network.

Regular network scanning should be performed to monitor for new devices and services, ensuring the network maintains a strong security posture over time.
